<summary><strong>Module 01</strong></summary>

### Reflection 1
You already implemented two new features using Spring Boot. Check again your source code and evaluate the coding standards that you have learned in this module. Write clean code principles and secure coding practices that have been applied to your code.  If you find any mistake in your source code, please explain how to improve your code.

    When coding the delete and edit features, I made sure the code was clean
    by following the same structure of the code for the create product and 
    list product features so that it was easy to read.
    I made the purpose of the new features clear and obvious by including the
    function of the feature in the html page names and in code in the java files
    for the controller, repository and service. For example, for the edit feature
    HTML is EditProduct.html and the functions in the controller are named
    editProductPage and editProductPost which also follow the naming style of the
    previous features. Moreover, I made sure that each function only had one purpose.

    To maintain code readability, I tried to refrain myself from adding unnecessary 
    comments since it is already easy to tell what the code does. I did not add
    any comments because I could tell what each function does and to avoid clutter.
    Additionally, I added empty lines between each function. I even tried to make the
    code simple as much as I can so that it is easy to understand and makes it
    less cluttered.
    If there was any mistake in my code, I did research on what I 
    could do to fix it instead of commenting it out. If I felt there were mistakes
    in the code I compared my code with the original source code from the module
    and fixed any syntax mistakes.
